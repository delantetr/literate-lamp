## Description
We set out like to create a platform for users to share and discover recipes, as well as create a grocery list for the recipes they decide to make. Users can explore a variety of recipes, generate shopping lists, and even create meal plans based on their chosen recipes. This project includes user authentication for user sign-up and login, a database consisting of users and recipes, and a UI that allows users to input recipes as well as create their shopping list based on the recipes that have saved. This app is has a React front end and utilizes a GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server, as well as MongoDB and Mongoose ODM for the database! 

## Installation
Clone the repo to your local machine, download the dependencies, and seed the database. Alternatively, the app can be accessed via heroku [here](https://stormy-hollows-30226-21c3ccd5e3ee.herokuapp.com/)!

Navigate to a single recipe by clicking on it. Once on the single recipe page, you may add the ingredients to a shopping list unique to your user. From the shopping list tab, you can review added lists of ingredients and add more items from the form on the page.
